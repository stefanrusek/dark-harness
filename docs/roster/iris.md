### 2026-07-15 — first round

Built the built-in system prompt (`src/prompt/system-prompt.ts`), skill discovery
(`src/prompt/skills.ts`), the bundled `cli-tools` skill (`src/prompt/skills/cli-tools/SKILL.md`),
and `README.md`. Full detail of what was built is in `docs/handoffs/prompt-docs.md`'s status
log — this is the durable part worth remembering on top of that.

**Judgment calls and why:**

- Wrote a deliberately minimal `SKILL.md` frontmatter parser (flat `key: value` lines,
  optional quoting) instead of pulling in a YAML library. Every real `SKILL.md` observed —
  including this project's own — fits that shape. Revisit only if a future skill actually
  needs nested YAML.
- The bundled `cli-tools` skill's content is imported via Bun's `with { type: "text" }` so
  `bun build --compile` embeds it directly into the binary — verified by actually compiling
  a throwaway binary, deleting the source file, and running it. This matters because a
  compiled `dh` has no on-disk `SKILL.md` next to it to fall back to.
- `CLI_TOOLS_SKILL`'s `{ name, description }` is parsed from the real `SKILL.md` at module
  load rather than hand-duplicated, so the prompt text can't silently drift from the file.

**Open thread (unresolved as of this entry):** flagged to Core that the `Skill` tool will
need a way to load a skill's *full* body by name at invocation time, not just the
name+description enumerated in the prompt. For skills found via `config.skillPaths` that's
a plain file read; for the bundled `cli-tools` skill there's no on-disk file in a compiled
binary. Proposed two options in `docs/handoffs/prompt-docs.md`'s status log (Core
special-cases builtins, or the agent loop pre-resolves builtin skill content some other
way) — check whether Core resolved this before assuming it's still open.

**Deferred, not done:** logo/wordmark, skills beyond `cli-tools`, a generated (vs.
hand-maintained) `dh.json` reference in the README.

### 2026-07-15 — Round 2: tool-call fire-and-forget discipline point

Added a sixth "Working discipline" bullet to `BASE_PROMPT` in `src/prompt/system-prompt.ts`:
**a tool call is never fire-and-forget** — named `Monitor`/`TaskOutput` explicitly as the
required follow-up action, and stated the failure mode negatively ("ending your turn right
after... is a failure") to match the exact behavior real testing observed in small/local
models (starting a backgrounded Bash call, then ending the turn without ever checking the
result). Full text and rationale logged in `docs/handoffs/prompt-docs.md` Round 2 status
entry.

**Judgment call:** kept the bullet in the same terse, bolded-phrase style as the other five
rather than a longer explainer — the handoff was explicit that burying this in a long
paragraph risks a small model missing it. Named the tools by name so the model has a
concrete action, not just an abstract obligation.

**Honesty note carried forward:** this is a prompt-text change, not a live-verified
behavioral fix — no way to test against an actual local model session from this
environment. Worth revisiting if someone later runs the same LM Studio test setup against
the updated prompt and can report back whether the polling behavior actually improved.

Gates (`typecheck`, `lint`, `test:coverage`) all pass, 100% coverage retained on
`src/prompt/system-prompt.ts`.

### 2026-07-15 — Round 3: TASK_FAILED convention + polling cadence

Closed two gaps an architect-level review (Fable) found: `TASK_FAILED` (the marker
`src/agent/loop.ts` scans for to detect self-reported failure, per ADR 0006's exit-code
contract) had never actually been taught to the model in the prompt — only implemented in
detection code. Added a "Report failure with `TASK_FAILED`" bullet to `BASE_PROMPT` stating
it as a hard requirement, with the success/failure semantics spelled out explicitly (no
marker + no tool call = success; marker = failure; never emit it on success). Also added a
"Pace your polling" bullet for the predictable next failure mode after Round 2's
fire-and-forget fix: telling a model to check back doesn't say how often, so it now spells
out do-other-work-or-wait-a-reasonable-interval, don't-tight-loop-Monitor.

**Judgment call:** put the polling-cadence bullet immediately after the fire-and-forget
bullet and had it explicitly reference "not too fast" so the two read as complementary
(check back — but don't spin) rather than in tension. Kept `TASK_FAILED` as its own bullet
rather than folding it into an existing one, since it's a distinct mechanism (final-response
text convention) from the tool-call-discipline bullets around it.

**Honesty note carried forward again:** still no way to behaviorally verify either addition
against a live small-model session from this environment — flagging as before rather than
overclaiming test coverage of prompt-text effectiveness.

Gates: `typecheck` and `test:coverage` pass (693/693 tests, 100% coverage on
`system-prompt.ts`). `lint` has one pre-existing failure on an untracked root `dh.json`
unrelated to `src/prompt/` — not touched, out of scope.

### 2026-07-15 — Round 4: README Bedrock setup section

Routed over from E2E's Round 5 (they built real Bedrock e2e coverage and flagged the README
only had a one-line sample config entry, no operator-facing setup guidance). Added an "AWS
Bedrock setup" subsection to `README.md` covering `provider.region`, the standard AWS
credential chain (env vars, `~/.aws/credentials`/`config`, instance/container roles — `dh`
does no custom credential handling), `ProviderError`-wrapped error surfacing (same shape as
Anthropic), and a practical note that Bedrock model ids are region/account-specific and a
seemingly-valid id can still be legacy/deprecated, so "invalid model"/"access denied" errors
are usually account-side, not a `dh` config bug. Full text and placement rationale in
`docs/handoffs/prompt-docs.md` Round 4 status entry.

Docs-only, no code gates apply this round.

### 2026-07-15 — Round 5: TASK_FAILED reliability (DH-0001)

Worked the ticket a coordinator/architect review raised: live testing against gemma-4-31b
showed the model writing a plain-English admission of failure but never emitting the
`TASK_FAILED` marker Round 3 taught, so `dh` reported exit code 0 for a self-acknowledged
failure. Strengthened the `TASK_FAILED` bullet in `BASE_PROMPT`
(`src/prompt/system-prompt.ts`): restated as "every time, no exceptions," named the exact
observed failure mode (write the honest paragraph, forget the token), added a worked
correct/incorrect example, and added a re-read-before-ending-your-turn self-check. Updated
`src/prompt/system-prompt.test.ts` assertions to match.

**Judgment call:** did not touch `src/agent/loop.ts`'s detection logic or propose a code
change to the self-report mechanism myself — the ticket's Open Question (whether ADR 0006's
exit-code contract needs a less string-dependent mechanism) is a real design question that
crosses into Core's territory and the exit-code contract, both named in CLAUDE.md §6 as
architect-review triggers. Escalated a concrete structural alternative (a mandatory
structured "report terminal outcome" tool call instead of free-text scanning) as a finding
in the ticket and in `docs/handoffs/prompt-docs.md`, rather than picking a direction
unilaterally from the Prompt domain.

**Honesty note carried forward, sharpened this round:** I have no way to re-run this against
a live small/local model from this environment, so I closed the loop on "make the prompt
stronger" but explicitly did NOT close the ticket — a stronger prompt is not proof the actual
reliability gap is gone, and the ticket's own Risk section already predicted this exact
limitation. Left `tracking/DH-0001-...md` at `status: implementing` with a status-log entry
explaining why, rather than marking it resolved on the strength of a text change I can't
behaviorally verify.

Gates: `typecheck`, `lint`, `test:coverage` all pass (806/806 tests, 100% coverage retained
on `src/prompt/system-prompt.ts`). `e2e` has pre-existing sandbox environment failures
(missing `tmux`, missing chromium binary) unrelated to this change.

### 2026-07-15 — Round 6: closed DH-0018, DH-0039, DH-0041, DH-0042

Worked four already-`implementing` Spile tickets to closed this round. Full detail in
`docs/handoffs/prompt-docs.md`'s Round 6 entry — durable notes here are the judgment calls
worth remembering on top of that.

**DH-0018 (systemPrompt override / discipline gaps):** split `BASE_PROMPT` into
`DISCIPLINE_PROMPT` (overridable) and an exported `REQUIRED_CONTRACT` const (`TASK_FAILED` +
Logging), and changed `loadSystemPrompt` to always append `REQUIRED_CONTRACT` after a custom
`config.systemPrompt` file's contents rather than treating the override as a full
replacement. Chose "always append" over "just warn" — strictly more robust, and testable in
a way a warning isn't. Also added interactive-vs-unattended language to the "escalate, don't
guess" bullet, and a new bullet naming `SendMessage`/`TaskStop` (not just `Monitor`/
`TaskOutput`) for handling a stuck sub-agent. Judged this as squarely inside Prompt's
ownership (prompt text + its own loader), not something needing architect sign-off, since it
doesn't touch `src/contracts/` or the exit-code detection logic itself — only guarantees the
existing string-based contract can't be silently dropped by config. Round 5's escalated
structural question (a `ReportOutcome`-style tool instead of string-scanning) is still open
and untouched.

**DH-0042 (README config gaps + drift check):** documented `options.maxTurns` and the
per-model pricing fields, and added `src/prompt/readme-config-sync.test.ts` — a
regex-based (not full-TS-parser) drift guard that fails `bun test src` if a `DhOptions`/
`ModelConfig` field goes unmentioned in README. Chose a test-suite check over a new CI
workflow: cheaper, runs everywhere the existing gate already runs, no CI/Release
coordination needed. Deliberately shallow (presence-only, not correctness) — said so in the
test file's own header so it's not mistaken for stronger validation later.

**DH-0039 / DH-0041 (doc-only):** verified every factual claim against actual source before
writing it down, not just the ticket summary — most notably for the MCP docs
(`docs/mcp-servers.md`): the config schema for `mcpServers` is real, but `src/agent/mcp.ts`
only returns a synthetic `ToolSearch` placeholder and `McpAuth` is a documented stub, so the
doc says that plainly instead of implying a working feature. Also cross-checked TUI
keybindings against `src/tui/state.ts`'s actual reducers rather than guessing, and the JSONL
log reference against `src/contracts/log.ts` directly (deferring to ADR 0005 as
authoritative if they ever disagree). Added `CHANGELOG.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md` at repo root and
linked all nine new docs from a new README "Further documentation" section.

**Open thread carried forward:** none of this round's work touches the Round 5 escalation
(structural `TASK_FAILED` reliability fix) — still awaiting architect/coordinator judgment,
untouched by this round's changes.

Gates: `typecheck`, `lint`, `test:coverage` all pass (809/809 tests, 100% coverage retained
across `src/prompt/`). `e2e` not run this round — unrelated to scope, same pre-existing
sandbox gaps (no `tmux`/chromium) as prior rounds.

### 2026-07-15 — DH-0056 (Output format / Markdown contract)

Added a new "## Output format" section to `REQUIRED_CONTRACT` in `src/prompt/system-prompt.ts`,
placed between the `TASK_FAILED` bullet and `## Logging` per Fable's D6 design — same
DH-0018 rationale (survives a custom `systemPrompt` override, since clients parse Markdown
unconditionally regardless of any operator persona prompt). Used the wording suggested in
the ticket verbatim. Added matching assertions to `system-prompt.test.ts` (default-prompt
inclusion, `REQUIRED_CONTRACT`'s own content, and an override-still-gets-it case), plus a
short README note (new paragraph after the JSONL-logging paragraph in "Tools, skills, and
sub-agents") that agent output renders as Markdown in both TUI and Web clients. This is
Prompt's whole piece of DH-0056 — the shared `src/markdown/` parser (Mary), TUI renderer
(Mary), Web renderer (Susan), and E2E hostile-bytes coverage (Hedy) are separate,
independent pieces per the ticket's D7 sequencing table; nothing here depends on them
landing first.

Gates: `typecheck`, `lint`, `test:coverage` all pass (957/957 tests, 100% coverage retained
project-wide, including `src/prompt/`). `e2e` not run — unrelated to scope, same
pre-existing sandbox gaps as prior rounds.

### 2026-07-16 — DH-0094: self-awareness section in the system prompt (joint with Core/Grace)

Added `renderSelfInfoSection(config, model, buildInfo = BUILD_INFO)` to
`src/prompt/system-prompt.ts`: concrete self-facts (dh version/git sha/dirty flag/release tag
from `BUILD_INFO`, the current agent's model config name + provider model id, and the other
model names configured in `dh.json`) instead of the vague hedging the ticket's live-testing
finding called out. Deliberately NOT folded into `BASE_PROMPT`/`buildDefaultSystemPrompt` —
those are computed once per config load, but the current model differs per agent (a
sub-agent may run a different `ModelConfig` than its parent), so it has to be a separate,
per-agent-callable function. `buildInfo` is an injectable third param (default `BUILD_INFO`)
purely for test determinism — `computeBuildInfo`'s own doc comment explains gitSha/releaseTag
are usually null outside a stamped release binary, so a test needs to override them to
exercise those branches. Wiring into the actual per-agent loop call (appending this section
after Core's `this.systemPrompt` at both `runRoot()` and `spawnAgent()` call sites) is
Core/Grace's piece — see her roster note same date.

Noted but out of scope: `src/cli.ts` has its own local `loadSystemPrompt`/
`DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` placeholder that never calls `src/prompt/system-prompt.ts`'s real
`loadSystemPrompt`/`buildDefaultSystemPrompt` — the default system prompt actually shipped by
`dh` today is still the `TODO(prompt domain)` placeholder text, not Iris's real discipline
prompt/skills enumeration. This DH-0094 self-info section still reaches the model regardless
(it's appended independently of what base prompt is in use), so it isn't blocked by that gap,
but the gap itself is real and pre-existing — flagging for the coordinator to file separately
rather than silently expanding this ticket's scope.

Gates: `typecheck`/`lint` clean. `test:coverage`: 1668 pass, 0 fail; `src/prompt/
system-prompt.ts` and `src/agent/runtime.ts` both 100% lines/funcs. `e2e`: 30/32 pass, same
pre-existing headless-Chromium-unavailable-in-sandbox failures every prior round has
footnoted, unrelated to this change. Closed DH-0094 (`transition.py DH-0094 closed
--resolution done`).
